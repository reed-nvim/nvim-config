##  Neovim Development Environment
- This project represents my own custom Neovim environment equiped with all the themes, plugins, lsps and formatters I require for my development workflow.
- Having used VS-Code for years prior to switching to Neovim, I tried my best to replicate the features of it  that I did like (whilst of course doing things in the vim way)
- This projected initially began as a fork from [TJ devies' Neovim kickstarter](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) repo, so go check that out if you're looking for a fresh/uncustomized base.
